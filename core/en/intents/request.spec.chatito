//the difference between request and list is the language the user uses to indicate a response type
//request.spec is for definite values (including binaries, which are definite values)
//users are doing request.spec when they structure their queries so they attempt to find value of X --
// -- in/on/included some item Y. 
// the response should then be the value of requested.spec rather than a list of trims with spec of value X
// the fallback in the case of a false binary, should be list.trims that have binary value true
